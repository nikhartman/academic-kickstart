# Biography

Hello! I'm Nik and I currently live and work in Lafayette, Indiana. As I write this, I am working as a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Station Q Purdue. We are working hard here to develop the semiconductor and superconductor material platform needed for topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero modes.

Previously I worked as a post doctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia. More specifically, I worked with [Joshua Folk](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~qdev/) doing quantum transport experiments. The work included thermodynamic measurements of single electrons in GaAs quantum dots, characterization InAs/aluminum nanowires for topological superconductivity, and investigations of impurity spin physics in single layer graphene.

Prior to moving to Vancouver in late 2015, I earned my PhD in Physics with [Nina MarkoviÄ‡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Markovi%C4%87). My thesis work was on spin transport experiments in carbon nanotube quantum dots. And, before any of that, I grew up in Harrisburg, PA and attended college at the University of Pittsburgh. Much of my interest in research science originated with my work in fluid dynamics with [Walter Goldburg](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~softmatt/) at Pitt.
